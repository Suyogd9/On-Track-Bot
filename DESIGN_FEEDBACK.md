| ITEM | SCORE | FEEDBACK |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <tr><th colspan=3> Setup </th></tr> |
| **Problem Stmt** | 15.0/15 | Very good |
| **Bot Description** | 7.5/10 | Ovall good, with perhaps a little too fine-grained detail (save that for the use-cases or other segments).   This sentence didn't quite make sense: "/moveTask done "card title/id" would move a card from "todo" to "inprogress""  <-- "done" implies that it's already done, not inprogress, no? --- This confusion is repeated in "Moves task from inprogress to todo" with the command "/moveTask done "card"".<br><br>The "concepts" section is not requested in the DESIGN.md description, and phrases like "Concept Hierarcy" make it less clear what's happening. |
| **Use Cases** | 10.0/15 | NOTE THIS IS FEEDBACK YOU PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED<br /><br />You have a start on your Use Cases, but they need Revisions:   In use cases 1-3, Subflows should be part of the main flow.  So if you have a subflow listed [s1], then [s1] should be somewhere in the main flow.    (you corrected this in UC4-6). --- Problem statement says "developer productivity," but I don't see in your use cases a way to just see the part of the board that applies to me (an individual developer) -- won't this just show everything that's happening on the Kanban board?  Is this just a tool for managers? |
| **Wireframes** | 12.5/15 | These show good details--but Wireframes are not screenshots -- They usually show a generic representation of the type of information that is displayed, rather than instances what the interaction would look like.    |
| **Storyboard** | 15.0/15 | Good use of descriptions + dialogue.  It was clear |
| **Architecture + Additional Patterns** | 30.0/30 | good |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Total** | 90.0/100 |  |
