| ITEM | SCORE | FEEDBACK |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PRESENTATION** | 20.0/25 | Creating a board on trello is probably a rarer activity â€” might be better to focus on the repetitive tasks.   Why is the 64-bit ID useful to show?   Good to include future work.  The core idea is good  and the implementation seems to cover the base functionality. |
| **PEER PRESENTATION EVALUATIONS** | 10.0/10 | (If you did 4 or more, your bonus will be on your individual moodle grade.) |
| **REPORT** | 15/15 |  |
| **360 PEER EVALUATION** | 50.0/50 | (If your moodle score is significantly lower than your team score, you might not have submitted a 360 peer evaluation.) |
